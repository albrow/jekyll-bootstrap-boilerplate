## What's This?

This is a boilerplate jekyll setup that includes bootstrap, and some other nifty stuff.
It is what I typically use when developing static websites. It's better than working
with static html and css files directly because:

- Sass is compiled automatically
- It includes a lot of cool features from Jekyll and Octopress
- You can use the liquid templating language to write DRYer code
- You can write pages and templates in any combination of html and markdown
- Assets are automatically uglified and gzipped
- Deployment tools for aws or rsync are included

NOTE: Though these tools work great for me, they're relatively untested.
I offer no guarantees that they will work for you. (But I hope someone might find them useful!)

## Basic Usage

#### Set Up:
- Fork or clone it.
- Run `cp -r jekyll-bootstrap-boilerplate/ your-new-project-name/`
- Then `cd your-new-project-name`

#### Adding stylesheets
- Bootstrap is already included.
- Your stylesheets should go in the custom folder. They will be automatically imported after bootstrap (so they will override it).

#### Adding pages
- Run `bundle exec rake g new_page[:your_page_name]`
- Jekyll will create a folder in the source directory with an index.markdown file.
- It's static, so requests to '/your_page_name' will be directed to the index file in that folder.

#### Serving Locally
- Run `bundle exec rake generate` to compile your static site to the public directory.
- You can run `bundle exec rake watch` to listen for changes and recompile automatically.
- Visit the public folder in your browser.
- Or (my preferred method) use [pow](http://pow.cx/)

#### Deploying to AWS S3 (and CloudFront)
- Set up an account and a bucket on [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/).
- Add a bucket and cf_distribution_id (optional) in _config.yml
- You will need to set two environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
which you can find on the AWS website after you register.
- Run `bundle exec rake deploy`
- Other deploy methods are available in Rakefile (I haven't personally tested them).
